It wants to have an early view of the success or failure of the new scheme. Indications are that the sales force is selling more policies but sales always vary in an unpredictable pattern from month to month and it is not clear if the scheme has made a significant difference.\n","\n","Life insurance companies typically measure the monthly output of a salesperson as the total sum assured for the policies sold by that person during a month. For example, suppose salesperson X has, in a month, sold seven policies for which the sums assured were £1000, £2500, £3000, £5000, £10000, £35000. X's output for that month will be the total of these sums assured, £61,500.\n","\n","Titan's new scheme is that the sales force receive low regular salaries but are paid large bonuses related to their output (i.e. to the total sum assured of policies sold by them). The scheme is expensive for the company, but the increase in sales should compensate. The agreement with the sales force is that if the scheme does not at least break even for the company, it will be discontinued after six months.\n","\n","\n","### Objective\n","\n","The scheme has now been in operation for four months. It has settled down after fluctuations in the first two months due to the changeover and senior executives at Titan Insurance want to understand the effectiveness of the new scheme they introduced. They reached out to the Data Science wing and asked them to conduct the analysis. A random sample of 30 salespersons was taken, their output measured for the penultimate month before the changeover and the fourth month after the changeover (to ensure that the chosen months are not too close to the changeover).\n","\n","As a member of the Data Science wing, you are assigned the task of analyzing the data and determining whether the new scheme has significantly raised sales outputs. A significance level of 5% has been chosen.\n","\n","\n","### Data Dictionary\n","\n","The provided dataset (*TitanInsurance.csv*) contains the following columns:\n","\n","1. `salesperson_id`: Unique ID of the salesperson\n","2. `old_scheme`: Monthly output (in 1000 pounds) of the salesperson before the changeover\n","3. `new_scheme`: Monthly output (in 1000 pounds) of the salesperson after the changeover"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"15c27a03"},"source":["## Import the necessary libraries\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Libraries to help with reading and
