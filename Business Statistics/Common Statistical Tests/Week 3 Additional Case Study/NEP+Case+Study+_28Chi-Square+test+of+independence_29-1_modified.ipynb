Each of them was asked whether they voted for the ruling party in 2019 or not and whether they are in favor of or against the NEP. Using the survey data, can we say with statistical evidence that voting preference is not independent of opinion on NEP?\n","\n","\n","### Data Dictionary\n","\n","The survey dataset contains the following columns\n","\n","- `college code`: Unique identification code for the college\n","- `favours NEP`: Is the college teacher in favour of NEP (Yes/No)\n","- `voted for ruling party`: Did the college teacher vote for the ruling party in 2019?
