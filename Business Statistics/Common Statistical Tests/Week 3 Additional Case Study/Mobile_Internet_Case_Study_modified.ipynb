You wish to test the validity of this statement. So, you reached out to friends and family to understand the time they spend per day accessing the internet via mobile devices. You received responses from 29 people and based on that, you want to check if there is enough evidence to suggest that the mean time spent per day accessing the internet via mobile devices is different from 144 minutes.
